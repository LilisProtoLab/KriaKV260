# Manual for the Kria KV260
The Kria KV260 Vision artificial intelligence (AI) Starter Kit by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) [1], used
for this study, is a kit that includes an field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a pre-configured system
on module (SOM) with a deep learning/data processing unit (DPU), carrier card and thermal solution. The
tutorials that were mainly followed for the usage of the FPGA were the Getting Started with Kria KV260
Vision AI Starter Kit [2] and the Quick Start Guide for Zynq UltraScale+ by Xilinx [3], as well as the Vitis
AI User Guide [4], but they have many faults and missing information. So, in this manual, we hope to clear
any doubts, reduce the amount of trial and error needed in future work and make the usage of the FPGA
smoother in general.
